Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
- On the "Web Service Instance - C3" instance, UDP port 20 associated with 'FTP' is accessible from the Internet.
- On the "Web Service Instance - C3" instance, UDP port 547 associated with 'DHCP' is accessible from the Internet.
- CIS 4.1 Ensure that no security group authorises the entry of IP address range 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- In the first 2 cases mentioned above, given that the security group entry rule currently authorises all traffic on all ports
It is essential to remove or restrict this rule from the security group and only open the ports required in the security group's incoming access rules.

- Limit the range of IP addresses authorised to access the application server on port 22.
