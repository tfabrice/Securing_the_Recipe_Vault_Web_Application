Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
the instance role policy is configured so that all S3 buckets are accessible from the application server.

Solution:
Policies must be defined to restrict access to S3 Buckets, for example defining a policy for access from the application server to a specific bucket free-recipes (or secret-recipes).



# Poor practice 2
The ACL rules for public and private subnets allow inbound and outbound traffic on all ports, without restriction.

Solution:
To remedy this problem, ACL rules need to be defined to minimise connectivity to the available network and thus reduce the traffic that can be sent to and from the subnet.
